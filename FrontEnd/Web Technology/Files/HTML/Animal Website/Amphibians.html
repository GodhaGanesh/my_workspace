        <h3>Amphibians: An Overview</h3>
        <p>Amphibians are a group of cold-blooded vertebrates that includes frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians. They are unique because they spend part of their lives in water and part on land. Amphibians are known for their remarkable life cycle, which typically involves metamorphosis‚Äîfrom aquatic larvae (like tadpoles) to adult forms that are often terrestrial. <b>Here are some key facts about amphibians:</b></p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        <h4><u>Life Cycle:</u></h4>

Metamorphosis: Most amphibians begin life as aquatic larvae (e.g., tadpoles in frogs) and undergo a dramatic transformation to become adults. This process includes the development of lungs for breathing air and limbs for movement on land. <br>
Skin:

Amphibians have smooth, permeable skin that allows them to absorb water and oxygen. This is why they often live in moist environments to prevent dehydration.
Their skin also serves as an important means of respiration, as some amphibians breathe through their skin in addition to using lungs. <br>
Cold-Blooded (Ectothermic):

Amphibians cannot regulate their body temperature internally and rely on external temperatures to control their body heat. As a result, they are often more active during warmer months and hibernate in cooler months. <br>
Respiration:

Amphibians generally have a dual system of respiration: they can breathe through their skin, and most also have lungs as adults. Some amphibians retain gills in adulthood, particularly aquatic species. <br>
Reproduction:

Amphibians typically lay their eggs in water, and the eggs hatch into larvae. The larvae are usually aquatic, and during metamorphosis, they change into their adult form. Amphibians use external fertilization (in frogs, for example) in most species, though some salamanders have internal fertilization. <br>
<h2>Types of Amphibians:</h2>
Frogs and Toads (Order: Anura): <br>

Frogs: Generally characterized by smooth, moist skin and long legs for jumping. They have a wide range of habitats from ponds and marshes to tropical rainforests. <br>
Toads: Typically have drier, warty skin and are more terrestrial than frogs. They are found in a wide range of habitats, including deserts and grasslands. <br>
Salamanders (Order: Urodela): <br>

Salamanders have elongated bodies, tails, and smooth skin. They can be found in moist environments like forests, streams, and caves. Some species retain their juvenile gill-like features (a condition known as neoteny) into adulthood. <br>
Caecilians (Order: Gymnophiona): <br>

Caecilians are legless, worm-like amphibians. They are often burrowers and are rarely seen, making them the least known group of amphibians. They have a similar structure to snakes but are actually amphibians, not reptiles. <br>
Habitat and Distribution:
Amphibians are found on every continent except Antarctica. They tend to live in moist environments like wetlands, rainforests, and near freshwater bodies such as ponds, lakes, and rivers. <br>
Some species have adapted to more arid conditions, with certain frogs and toads having developed mechanisms to survive in deserts. <br>
Conservation Status:
Amphibians are facing significant threats due to habitat loss, climate change, pollution, disease (like chytridiomycosis), and the pet trade. Many species are considered endangered, and amphibian populations worldwide have been declining rapidly. <br>
<h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
Some amphibians, like the axolotl, are known for their ability to regenerate lost limbs, gills, and even parts of their heart and brain. <br>
The golden poison dart frog of Colombia is one of the most poisonous animals in the world, with its skin secreting toxins that can be fatal. <br>

<b><mark>Amphibians play essential roles in ecosystems, including controlling insect populations and serving as food for other wildlife. Their permeable skin makes them sensitive to environmental changes, making them important indicators of ecosystem health.</mark></b>
