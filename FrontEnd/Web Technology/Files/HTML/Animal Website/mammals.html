        <h3>Mammals: An Overview</h3>
        <p>Mammals are a class of animals known for several distinctive characteristics that set them apart from other vertebrates. They belong to the class Mammalia, and they include a wide variety of species, ranging from tiny shrews to large whales. Below is a detailed exploration of mammals' unique features, types, and examples.</p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics of Mammals :</h3>
        <p><h5><u>‚≠êHair or Fur:</u></h5>
            Mammals are the only group of animals that have hair or fur at some point in their life cycle. Hair serves several functions, such as insulation, camouflage, and sensory functions.

            <h5><u>‚≠êWarm-Blooded (Endothermic):</u></h5>            
            Mammals are endothermic, meaning they can regulate their body temperature internally. This allows them to remain active in various environmental conditions, unlike cold-blooded animals that depend on external heat sources.

            <H5><U>‚≠êLive Birth (Except Monotremes):</U></H5>
            Most mammals give birth to live young, a trait called viviparity. However, monotremes (like the platypus and echidna) are exceptions as they lay eggs.
            Mammals usually provide parental care after birth, often in the form of nursing their young with milk produced by mammary glands.

            <H5><U>‚≠êMammary Glands:</U></H5>
            All female mammals have mammary glands, which produce milk to feed their offspring. This is one of the most defining characteristics of mammals, hence the name "mammal."
            
            <H5><U>‚≠êVertebrates:</U></H5>
            Mammals are vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone made of vertebrae.

            <H5><U>‚≠ê Middle Ear Bones:</U></H5>
            Mammals are unique in having three bones in the middle ear: the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes). These bones help in hearing by transmitting sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.

            <H5><U>‚≠êSpecialized Teeth:</U></H5>
            Mammals often have different types of teeth (incisors, canines, molars) that are specialized for different diets (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores). This is different from most other vertebrates, which often have uniform teeth.
