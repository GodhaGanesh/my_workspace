to build single page application

before angular and react developers use Ajax + jQery which was creating singlr page application
# in this it follows xhr request moudule.
# AJAX stands for Asynchronus javaScript + xml
# JQuery is one of the most popular JS library where 
# xhr stands for xml http request.

#this approach has many disadvantages. so in 2009, a google developer introduce a framework angular which is used to created SPA.

# later in 2013, a new era started, a facebook developer invented react library which took the place of angular.
# when the application is very huge developers prefers angular.
# whenever it is small application developers prefers React.

  REACT :-
****************
# React is one of the most popular and demanding library in the market because of it's features.
# React is a small UI library which is use to build single page application.
